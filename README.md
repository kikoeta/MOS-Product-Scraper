# MOS-Product-Scraper
A basic python web scraper to get and filter NWS MOS product data and display it in the terminal for the purposes of WxChallenge

Basically, the goal with this project was to simplify the very confusing and lengthy to process NWS MOS product text bulletins. I wanted to be able to get the lines I needed out of the table, which I would at some point, like to sort over a range.

You will need pandas, BeautifulSoup (bs4), selenium, openpyxl, and xlrd to make this work.
